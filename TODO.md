- re-think the tests
    - ~clean up the hypothesis tests~
        - ~fill out the missing pieces~
    - use the in-memory back-end for most things
    - tests:
        - rethink the naming schemes
            - test_database_integration/test_save_load
                - various kinds of serialisation (single, grouped, one after the other etc.)
                - note that it's supplemented by hypothesis
            - test_database_integration/test_db_state_with_hypothesis
            - test_database_integration/test_make_move_plan
            - test_database_integration/test_locking
            - test_database_integration/test_paralell_and_progress
                - parallel and progress bars
                    - do this using the in-memory backend
            - test_index_manpulation_integration/test_to_category_index
            - test_index_manpulation_integration/test_unify_index_levels
        - other bits and pieces
        - use code coverage to help guide this


- add DBReader so we can do reads with an in-memory index
    - include a context manager so the lock is auto-released
- database docs
    - regroup demo in docs (not in core API so we don't take responsibility for deletion)
    - parallel tricks
    - progress tricks
- create the speed benchmarking tool/notebook
    - just dump results with operating system, date and commit used to make them
- parallel ops
    - [ ] tests of and docstrings for layers created in parallelisation and related stuff
- push --doctest-report ndiff upstream in Makefile
- push dependency pinning and testing section in docs' navigation upstream
- push footnotes extension upstream
- push fixes to dependency pinning text upstream
- push tqdm lack of intersphinx upstream
