- parallel ops
    - delete
        - [ ] tests of and docstrings for layers created `figure_out_progress_bars`, `apply_op_parallel_progress`
        - [ ] tests that code doesn't explode with key combos of things
            - parallel or not
            - no progress bars, both progress bars via True, injecting both progress bars
                - 12 tests (4 parallel options, 3 bar options), that's enough
    - load
    - save_grouped
        - implementation
            - create the index and file_map in the main process. Save them in the main process
            - create the map from data chunks to data files in the main process.
            - save the data and data chunks in threads/other processes.
        - single op
        - parallel thread
        - parallel process
        - nested progress bars
    - prepare_for_overwrite
        - don't do this, too hard to think through how to test
          that you're not accidentally removing something in one thread that you need in this one
            - i.e. don't offer any parallelisation to the prepare_for_overwrite interface
- database docs
    - regroup demo in docs (not in core API so we don't take responsibility for deletion)
    - parallel tricks
    - progress tricks
