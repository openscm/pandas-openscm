- re-think the tests
    - ~clean up the hypothesis tests~
        - ~fill out the missing pieces~
    - tests:
        - other bits and pieces
        - use code coverage to help guide this
    - use the in-memory back-end for most things


- add DBReader so we can do reads with an in-memory index
    - include a context manager so the lock is auto-released
- database docs
    - regroup demo in docs (not in core API so we don't take responsibility for deletion)
    - parallel tricks
    - progress tricks
- create the speed benchmarking tool/notebook
    - double these up as key test of putting the different data and index back-ends together
    - mark as superslow
    - dump results with operating system, date and commit used to make them so they can be included in docs
- parallel ops
    - [ ] tests of and docstrings for layers created in parallelisation and related stuff
- push --doctest-report ndiff upstream in Makefile
- push dependency pinning and testing section in docs' navigation upstream
- push footnotes extension upstream
- push fixes to dependency pinning text upstream
- push tqdm lack of intersphinx upstream
