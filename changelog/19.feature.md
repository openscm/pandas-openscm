- Made the database portable by only storing relative paths in the file map. This allows the database to be converted to an archive with [pandas_openscm.db.OpenSCMDB.to_gzipped_tar_archive][] and then unpacked elsewhere with [pandas_openscm.db.OpenSCMDB.from_gzipped_tar_archive][]
- Added [pandas_openscm.db.path_handling][] to clarify how we handle paths internally to support portability
- Added support for specifying the name of the output columns via [pandas_openscm.db.OpenSCMDB.load][], [pandas_openscm.db.reader.OpenSCMDBReader.load][] and [pandas_openscm.io.load_timeseries_csv][]
