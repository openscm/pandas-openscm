- Required `db_dir` to be passed when initialising [pandas_openscm.db.reader.OpenSCMDBReader][]. This is required to support portable databases
- Renamed `out_column_type` to `out_columns_type` in [pandas_openscm.io.load_timeseries_csv][] for consistency with the rest of the API
- Bumped the minimum supported version of [filelock](https://py-filelock.readthedocs.io/) to 3.12.3, as only this version handles automatic creation of directories for the lock
